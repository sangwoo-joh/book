## An Old Hacker&rsquo;s Tips

I stole this from [here](https://madned.substack.com/p/an-old-hackers-tips-on-staying-employed).


### The &ldquo;Do It Anyway&rdquo; Principle

> &#x2026; but sooner or later you will end up on some task or project that is difficult to accomplish and/or generally unpleasant, all due to factors outside of your control.

> .. would be the people that somehow got their tasks done anyway, even though there were ridiculous constraints imposed by our environment issues that made it a lot harder.

> The brutal truth though is, &#x2026; We are all constantly measured in the eyes of our employers by what we actually deliver, and those who can find a way to succeed even in the face of adversity will always have an advantage over those who cannot, or do not want to.


### The &ldquo;Two-and-Done&rdquo; Rule

> It has to do with how to handle disagreements that come up at work&#x2026;. have a pretty strong desire to always have the right answer to things, &#x2026; I would tenaciously argue my point, without letting go.

> &#x2026; I would let them know just why they were **wrong**, and why we needed to do it **my way** &#x2026; because something that I knew was better was being ignored.

> But this take-no-prisoners approach to debate ****did not**** do me any good&#x2026; it would negatively impact my ability to affect change. If I did this too often, people would begin to see me as argumentative, difficult to work with, not a team player, &#x2026;.

> &#x2026;. I&rsquo;m still a big fan of being right all the time, &#x2026; What&rsquo;s changed over the years though is first, an enhanced understanding that I in fact ****am not right all the time****. But also that even when I am right, it isn&rsquo;t always a guarantee that others will ****follow my advice****, and if they do not, that it&rsquo;s sill **OK**.

> &#x2026; I will state my case **the first time**, and if whoever is arguing to the contrary does not agree after hearing my position, I&rsquo;ll **let it go**. But the next time the opportunity comes up, I will argue my point **again**. Maybe allowing for a gap of time for people to consider my original point, or maybe allowing me time to refine and rephrase my ideas to be more convincing.

Maybe allowing for a gap of time for people to consider my original point, or maybe allowing me time to refine and rephrase my ideas to be more convincing.If I fail to &#x2026; the second time though, ****I am done.**** &#x2026;. &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s go your way then. I still don&rsquo;t completely agree with everything proposed here, but I think I&rsquo;ve made my case, and we ened to ****move on****.&rdquo;

> Yielding in an argument like this has some weird, powerful effects. One is it kind of releases you from responsibility if things should go wrong. And if a truly bad decision has been made, it is actually pretty likely that things **will** start going wrong. If you fail to convince people after two tries, you really do have to get behind the decision, and not try to sabotage or undermine it.

> &#x2026; it bumps up your personal brand, as someone who should maybe be listened to more often.
